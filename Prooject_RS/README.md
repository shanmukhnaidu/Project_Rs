# Overlook

An application commissioned by the Overlook Hotel. The app is tailored around the hotel's esteemed guests; delivering the bookings schedule of all of the hotel's most finest quarters. Never doubt that you'll find the room that you deserve, because at the Overlook, you are taken care of.

## Features

### The Guest

- Guest may book a hotel room
- Guest may view any prior or future bookings
- Guest may narrow down their search by date if the many rooms become exhausting
- If guest feels awful looking at single rooms or junior suites, then they may view just the residental suite instead
- Dare I say, if there is ever a mistake in availabilty then will be do our _**best**_ in our duty to make things right.

### The Manager

- The managers will also get their own version of the application
- They may see what all of the many rooms are available for the current date
- They can see the influx of wealth of the current day
- No math ever required to find out the percentage of available rooms for the current date
- They can search any guest they desire, amongst their bookings and spendings
- They can reserve a room for any guest
- But as any good manager ought to, they can axe the guest bookings if they deserve it
